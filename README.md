# Snake-Game
bet you have never seen one of THESE before!

this script was originally made as the final assignment for my python class. However, all the assignment needed to do was run snake, and if you lost you would need to run the script again. I decided to add the following by myself: An enemy snake, a score counter, the option to pause, the option to restart, a choice of game speed, and the ability to choose your snake's color.
